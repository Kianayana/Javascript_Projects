# Javascript_Projects

This repository is for all of my Javascript projects and assignments for the Javascript course. 

Within this course, I created a Pizza Menu, Tic-Tac-Toe Game, and a Calculator. 

### Pizza Menu 
I created a pizza menu that allowed you to pick toppings and then it would calculate the price based on the tppings you chose. 

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game 
The classic game of tic-tac-toe and it randomly chooses who goes first and you can choose which token is used. Then the computer randomly places the opposing tokens to try and win the game.

### Calculator
It is a basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
